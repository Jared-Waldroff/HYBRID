## 🏋️ OLYMPIC WEIGHTLIFTING

### Competition Lifts

**Snatch**: Floor to overhead in one motion, catch in squat
**Clean & Jerk**: Floor to rack (clean) + rack to overhead (jerk)

### Snatch Progression
1. Overhead squat (establish position)
2. Snatch grip behind-neck press
3. Snatch deadlift (bar path)
4. Hang power snatch
5. Power snatch from floor
6. Full snatch

**Common Issues**
- Bar swings out → Stay over bar longer
- Misses forward → Don't cut second pull short
- Can't catch low → OHS mobility, snatch balance

### Clean Progression
1. Front squat (rack position)
2. Clean deadlift
3. Hang power clean
4. Power clean from floor
5. Full clean

### Jerk Styles
- **Split Jerk**: Most common, stable catch
- **Power Jerk**: Quick turnover athletes
- **Squat Jerk**: Very mobile athletes

## 🏃‍♂️ HYROX TRAINING PROTOCOLS

### Race Structure
HYROX = 8 km running (8 x 1km) + 8 functional workout stations:
1. SkiErg (1000m)
2. Sled Push (50m, Men: 152kg/Women: 102kg Pro)
3. Sled Pull (50m, same weights)
4. Burpee Broad Jumps (80m)
5. Rowing (1000m)
6. Farmers Carry (200m, 2x24kg/2x16kg)
7. Sandbag Lunges (100m, 20kg/10kg)
8. Wall Balls (100 reps, 9kg/6kg)

### HYROX Periodization (8-12 Week Prep)

**Base Phase (Weeks 1-4)**
- Build running volume: 25-35 km/week
- 2-3 Zone 2 runs (40-60 min)
- 1 tempo run (20-30 min at race pace)
- 2-3 strength sessions
- Practice individual stations

**Build Phase (Weeks 5-8)**
- Increase to 35-45 km/week
- Add station-specific strength work
- Introduce "doubles" (run + station + run)
- SkiErg intervals: 4x500m @ race pace

**Peak Phase (Weeks 9-11)**
- Full race simulations (2 during this phase)
- Reduce volume 20-30%, maintain intensity

**Taper (Final Week)**
- 50% volume reduction
- Keep 2-3 short, sharp efforts

### HYROX-Specific Sessions

**Roxzone Session**
- 8x(200m run + 15 wall balls + 200m run)
- Maintain consistent pace throughout

**Station Endurance**
- 1000m SkiErg + 500m Row, repeat 3x

**Running Efficiency**
- 8x1km at target race pace, 90s recovery

### Pacing Strategy
- **1km runs**: Consistent splits (not fastest early)
- **Stations**: 80-85% effort, save legs for runs
- **Transitions**: Walk first 20m after stations
- **Wall Balls**: Break into sets of 10-15`;

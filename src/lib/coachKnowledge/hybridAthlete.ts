## 🎯 HYBRID ATHLETE PERIODIZATION

### Interference Effect Management
- Separate strength and endurance by 6+ hours when possible
- If same session: strength FIRST, then cardio
- Prioritize the quality most important for your goal
- Accept you may not be elite at everything simultaneously

### Priority Training Blocks
- Block 1 (4-6 weeks): Strength emphasis, maintenance cardio
- Block 2 (4-6 weeks): Aerobic base, maintenance strength
- Block 3 (4-6 weeks): Sport-specific peaking

### Weekly Template (5 Days - Strength + Endurance)
| Day | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| Mon | Strength (Lower) |
| Tue | Zone 2 Cardio (45 min) |
| Wed | Strength (Upper) |
| Thu | Intervals/HIIT |
| Fri | Strength (Full Body) |
| Sat | Long Aerobic (60-90 min) |
| Sun | Rest/Mobility |

### 6-Day Competition Prep
| Day | AM | PM |
|-----|----|----|
| Mon | Strength | Zone 2 (optional) |
| Tue | Sport Skills | - |
| Wed | Strength | Zone 2 |
| Thu | Intervals | - |
| Fri | Active Recovery | - |
| Sat | Race Simulation | - |

### Balancing Multiple Sports
When training for multiple disciplines:
1. Identify PRIMARY goal (what matters most)
2. Put primary sport early in week when fresh
3. Use secondary sport as active recovery
4. Monitor fatigue - hybrid athletes overtrain easily
5. Periodize: can't peak for everything at once`;
